Figure out basic syntax (as well as the simple stuff, i.e. hello world)

  -$ for Jquery
  -$( document ).ready(function() {
    console.log( 'ready!' );
    });
  -Above is the basis for passing the function to jquery for execution
  -$('.header')
  -Used to select an element
  -$( '<p>Hello!</p>' ); 
  -creates a new <p> element with content, not placed on page until told to do so

write and test a simple program

  -Updated a test index to use Jquery, and do a basic document load

Look into common jquery applications

  -.animate
  -.addClass
  -.css


Come up with an idea I'd Like to execute in Jquery

Page opens to a Wallpaper with a "Get Started" button.  Click the button, and the page opens, with the two pieces of the image sliding out with the button fading out

Try and execute said idea while learning as much as I can!
